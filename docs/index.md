# Welcome to Pharo Launcher

The fastest way to get a working Pharo environment: image (an object space with Pharo Core libraries) + virtual machine is to use Pharo Launcher. Pharo Launcher is a tool allowing you to easily download Pharo core images (Pharo stable version, Pharo development version, old Pharo versions, Pharo Mooc) and automatically get the appropriate virtual machine to run these images.
